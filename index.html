		<b>The Witcher</b> is a 2007 action role-playing game developed by <i>CD Projekt Red</i> for <i>Microsoft Windows</i> and <i>CD Projekt Red</i> on OS X. 
		It was based on the fantasy novel series The Witcher by Polish author <b>Andrzej Sapkowski</b>. The game's story takes place after the events of the main saga.
		</p>
		<p>
		It was released in 2007 to positive reviews from critics and received an aggregate score of 81/100 on Metacritic. 
		In 2009, a console version, <b>The Witcher: Rise of the White Wolf</b>, was scheduled for release using an entirely new engine and combat system. 
		This was suspended as a result of payment problems with console developers Widescreen Games. 
		The first game has, to date, two sequels, namely The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings in 2011 and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2015.
		</p>
		<p>
		A remake of <b>The Witcher</b> was announced in October 2022, which was formerly first teased under the codename "Canis Majoris". 
		Entitled The Witcher Remake, it will be developed using Unreal Engine 5, 
		the same engine in use for the planned second trilogy. Fool's Theory will mainly develop the remake with full creative supervision from 
		The Witcher series staff and CD Projekt Red.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		There are three camera styles available in The Witcher: two isometric perspectives, where the mouse is used to 
		control most functions, and an over-the-shoulder view, which brings the player closer to the in-game combat 
		while limiting vision. In all three views the controls can be changed to be primarily mouse focused or a 
		combined keyboard and mouse approach. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The story takes place in a medieval fantasy world and follows Geralt of Rivia, one of a few traveling monster 
		hunters who have supernatural powers, known as Witchers. Players can choose one of three fighting styles to use 
		in different situations and against different foes. The fast style allows for more rapid, less-damaging attacks 
		with a higher chance of hitting faster enemies; the strong style deals more damage in exchange for a slow attack speed, 
		and a lower chance to hit faster enemies; and the group style features sweeping attacks best used if Geralt is surrounded.
		The player can switch between the styles at any point. Both of Geralt's main swords also have distinctively different 
		combat styles from other weaponry, and serve specific purposes. The steel blade is used to fight humans and other 
		flesh-and-blood beings, while the silver sword is more effective against supernatural monsters and beasts 
		(against some of which steel may have no effect whatsoever). With precise timing, the player can link Geralt's 
		attacks into combos to damage enemies more effectively.
